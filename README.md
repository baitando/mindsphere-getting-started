# MindSphere Getting Started

This repository contains a sample Typescript application which simulates and sends data to MindSphere.
It was created as part of [one of my posts on the mimacom blog](https://blog.mimacom.com/getting-started-with-mindsphere/).

This repository makes use of the [MindConnect-NodeJS project](https://github.com/mindsphere/mindconnect-nodejs).
Running it requires:

* A MindSphere tenant with a data model matching the one of this sample.
* A private key stored in the file `private.key`.
* An agent configuration stored in the file `agentconfig.json`.

For further details of how to achieve this please have a look at my [mimacom blog post](https://blog.mimacom.com/getting-started-with-mindsphere/).
